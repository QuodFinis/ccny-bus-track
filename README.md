CCNY-Bus-Track
CCNY Bus Tracker will be a web application that will display a map of CCNY bus tracks and their estimated time of arrival. It will also provide weather information on whether the buses are running or not.

Proposal
This application will be built using React JS and NodeJS. It will have 2 UI, 1 for students and 1 for bus drivers. There will be login for both users to determine the UI. The application will provide estimates of the bus arrival after asking the users about their location based on the location of the bus.

Plan
In order to build this application we need to do the following:

Learn about the CCNY Bus schedule.
Estimate the bus transit times.
Implement the login system.
The start screen will have 3 buttons and based on the selection of the user, we will provide estimate of the times.
